        <li>You can only receive scholarship funding to study this NPQ with one provider. If you do not wish to proceed with [Provider] you will need to contact them.</li>
        <li>If you’ve previously failed or withdrawn from this course, then you’re not eligible for scholarship funding. If you do not believe you’ve failed or withdrawn from this course please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>PLACEHOLDER COPY: DfE targeted support funding is available for your school. Your school will
      receive £600 to help cover the costs that may emerge from the time you need to do an NPQ.</p>

      <p>You can still register for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} but you’ll need to pay for it another way. Contact your course provider to discuss your funding options.</p>
