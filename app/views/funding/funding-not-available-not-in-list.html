      <p>Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} NPQ because your workplace is not in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs#scholarship-funding-for-autumn-2024">list of settings that are eligible for funding</a>.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.</p>
      <p>For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>cover the full cost of the course</li>
        <li>share the cost of the course with you</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Not chosen Maths, SENCO, EHCO, Headship -->
      {% if data['choosenpq'] != "NPQ for Early Years Leadership (NPQEYL)" %}
        <p>However, you may be eligible for scholarship funding for one of the following courses:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>leading primary mathematics</li>
          <li>headship</li>
          <li>special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)</li>
          <li>early headship coaching offer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">You can <a href="/choose-npq.html">go back and select one of these courses</a> instead to check if you're eligible.</p>
