        Funding 
      </h1>
      <p>Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} NPQ because you do not work in one of the eligible settings, such as state-funded schools.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.</p>
      <p>For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>cover the full cost of the NPQ</li>
        <li>share the cost of the NPQ with you</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However, you may be eligible for scholarship funding for one of the following courses:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>leading primary mathematics</li>
        <li>headship</li>
        <li>special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)</li>
        <li>early headship coaching offer</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">You can <a href="/choose-npq.html">go back and select one of these courses</a> instead to check if you're eligible.</p>
