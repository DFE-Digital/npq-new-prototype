      <p>You’ve already been allocated scholarship funding for the Early headship coaching offer (EHCO) with [provider].</p>

      <p>If you need to change something about your registration for the EHCO, email continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re taking the EHCO again</h2>

      <p>Continue to register.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You would need to pay for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} NPQ another way if you were previously funded but you did not pass or withdrew from the course. For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
        <li>cover the full cost of the course</li>
        <li>share the cost of the course with you</li>
