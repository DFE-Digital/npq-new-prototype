        Request a teacher reference number (TRN) for a national professional qualification (NPQ)
      </h1>

      
<p>You need a TRN to do an NPQ, even if you’re not a teacher.</p> 

<p>If you do not have one, you can request one.</p>

<p>Before you request one, check if you have one already using <a href="https://find-a-lost-trn.education.gov.uk/start">Find a lost TRN</a>.</p> 

<p>For example, you’ll have a TRN if you have qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS).</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Request a TRN</h2>

<p>To request a TRN you need to send a secure email to the Department for Education (DfE) using <a href="https://manager.galaxkey.com/services/registerme">Galaxkey</a>, including some personal details and proof of identity:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Create a <a href="https://manager.galaxkey.com/services/registerme">Galaxkey</a> account.</li>
  <li>Compose an email in Galaxkey to qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk with the subject line ‘Request TRN for NPQ’.</li>
  <li>Include the following personal details in body of the email:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>full legal name</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>email address – DfE will respond to this email address with your TRN</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attach a photo or scanned copy of your proof of identity. You can use one of the following:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>passport</li>
      <li>driving licence (full or provisional)</li>
      <li>certificate of residence</li>
      <li>birth certificate</li>
