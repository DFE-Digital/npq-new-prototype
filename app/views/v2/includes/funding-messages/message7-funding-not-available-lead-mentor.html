  <p>You’re not eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} NPQ as you do not work in one of the eligible settings, such as state-funded schools.</p>
  <p>This means that you would need to pay for this course another way. For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cover the full cost of the course</li>
    <li>share the cost of the course with you</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, as a lead mentor for an accredited ITT provider, you’re eligible for scholarship funding for the Leading teacher development NPQ.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="../choose-npq">go back and select the Leading teacher development NPQ</a> instead.</p>
