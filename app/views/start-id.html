      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>register for an NPQ or the early headship coaching offer</li>
        <li>view a current or previous registration</li>
        <li>view course status</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You also need to apply separately with your training provider. They’ll contact you once you’ve registered.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>You need to know which NPQ you want to do and who your provider is. If you have not chosen yet, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-professional-qualification-npq-courses">find out about NPQ courses</a>.</p>

      <p>You also need a teacher reference number (TRN) to register for an NPQ, even if you’re not a teacher. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn">Learn about TRNs</a> including how to request one if you do not have one.</p>

      <p>If you work in early years or childcare, <a href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/childcare">check if your workplace is registered with Ofsted</a> and get their Ofsted unique reference number (URN) if they have one.</p>

      <p>To register for an NPQ, you’ll need to create a DfE Identity account or sign in to your account.</p>
